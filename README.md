# FractureLocalization

Repo for research project in deep learning at Link√∂ping University Spring 2022.

The project focuses on localization of fractures which consequently can be used to classify regular and atypical femoral fractures. An issue in the radiology domain is that hospitals use different radiological equipment which leads to different images sizes as well as different bit depths. In this project I aim to predict the center-point of the fracture. An advantage to first predicting the center-point is that images can be cropped into standardized shapes, containing only the most relevant pixel-information for classifying atypical femoral fractures. It also gives the opportunity to use a wider range of classifiers that would not be able to handle input images of different sizes.

The dataset is unfortunately not open-source at this time.
